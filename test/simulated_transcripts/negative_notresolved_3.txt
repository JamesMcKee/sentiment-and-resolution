Member: Hi, I’ve been waiting weeks for a resolution to my pre-authorization request for a procedure. My name is Alex Walker, and my member ID is MEM987654.
Customer Support: Thank you for calling, Alex. Let me pull up your request. [pause] It appears the pre-authorization is still under review, and there’s no further update at this time.
Member: Weeks? This is ridiculous. I need this procedure done, and I’m just sitting here waiting for your system to catch up?
Customer Support: I understand your frustration, but unfortunately, the review process is taking longer than usual. I don’t have control over the timelines.
Member: This is beyond annoying. Why does it take so long? You should be doing better than this.
Customer Support: I’m sorry, Alex. I wish I could provide a quicker resolution, but I don’t have any more information.
Member: Well, I’m just supposed to sit here and wait, right? This is completely unacceptable.
