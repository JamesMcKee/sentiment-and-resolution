Member: Hi, I’ve been trying to get my claim reprocessed for the past month, and nothing has happened. My name is Steven Lee, and my member ID is MEM234987.
Customer Support: Thank you for calling, Steven. Let me look into that for you. [pause] It appears the claim is still pending review.
Member: A month? This is unacceptable. Why is it taking so long to process something so simple?
Customer Support: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, the review process is out of my control, and I don’t have a timeline for completion.
Member: This is unbelievable. How am I supposed to trust this company when you can’t even process a claim in a timely manner?
Customer Support: I’m sorry for the delay. I know it’s frustrating, but I don’t have more information at the moment.
Member: This is a joke. I’m so done with this insurance company.
