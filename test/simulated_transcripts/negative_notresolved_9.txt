Member: Hi, I’m calling because my premium was charged incorrectly. I need this fixed immediately. My name is John Roberts, and my member ID is MEM908172.
Customer Support: Thanks for calling, John. Let me look into your account. [pause] It appears the charge was applied incorrectly, but I can’t make any changes from here.
Member: You’ve got to be kidding me. How can you not fix something so simple?
Customer Support: I understand your frustration, but you’ll need to reach out to the billing department for corrections.
Member: This is unbelievable. I’m paying you guys for a service, and I can’t even get a simple mistake fixed?
Customer Support: I apologize for the inconvenience. They should be able to assist you further.
Member: I’m really fed up with this company. I shouldn’t have to keep jumping through hoops just to get what I paid for.
